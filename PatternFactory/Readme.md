# Factory

In the [Factory1](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternFactory/Factory1), [Factory2](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternFactory/Factory2), [Factory3](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternFactory/Factory3) folders, you can find different types of Factory implementations. In each of the options featured pizza and its creation. In its simplest form, the factory simply creates a number of objects, depending on the type of interest. In the next version, subclasses appear, represented by different cities, where objects are already created not only depending on the type of pizza, but also on the city. In the most complex implementation, interfaces and ingredients appear, where each type of pizza is assigned its own ingredient, after which the type and city are selected, based on which the factory creates an object (pizza).

In the [FactoryProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternFactory/FactoryProject) folder, the implementation of the Factory with subclasses, where there is a bakery with cakes. Bakeries are located in Moscow and Kazan, and depending on where the client is located and what kind of cake he wants, such an object will be created later.
