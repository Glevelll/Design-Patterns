# Strategy

The idea in [StrategyProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternStrategy/StrategyProject) is that there is an Athlete class that can either run, or jump, or throw projectiles. Also, he can run either long or short distances and jump either long or high. Next, athletes are given, where each individual is given characteristics, whether he can run, jump or throw. After that, each athlete is called according to his type (in main I have this type of Sprint - sprinting)
