# Singleton

A folder called [Singleton](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternSingleton/Singleton) contains examples of the implementation of this pattern, ranging from an imperfect classical implementation to a practical solution to all the problems of this pattern through enum. In addition, the folder contains a unique ChocolateBoiler object, which is implemented without using a pattern, with a classic use and through enum.

In a folder called [SingletonProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternSingleton/SingletonProject), there is a unique NoteBook object, which is implemented through the classics. Nothing supernatural, you can create a file, write something to it and delete the record.
