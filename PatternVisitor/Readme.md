# Visitor

The [Visitor](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternVisitor/Visitor) file contains an implementation related to the construction of shapes, which provides the visitor and dot interfaces that define the behavior, which handles the drawing of the shape. The visitor can refer to a circle, a rectangle and a complex figure to draw, after which information about the figure will be displayed, where some coordinates have been entered in advance.

In the [VisitorProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternVisitor/VisitorProject) file, you can find the computer and its parts. There is a main class - a computer that has a keyboard, monitor and mouse. The visitor accesses each of the parts of the computer, and each class responds to this visit "...on/on".
