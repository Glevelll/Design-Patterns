# Composite

The [Linker](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternComposite/Linker) folder is a continuation of the [Iterator](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternIterator) idea. Here are two restaurants in which you need to create a tree structure that can work with nested menu groups and menu items, where the same operations can be applied to combinations and individual objects. Here, adding to the menu takes place in main, and the MenuComponent class helps to do this, where menu actions are written. The waitress stores only the allMenus field, which contains information on each menu from different restaurants.

The [LinkerProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternComposite/LinkerProject) folder also contains the idea from the [Iterator](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternIterator) where the output of the directories of two car dealerships is implemented. In the same way as in the Linker project, the CatalogComponent class is specified, which indicates what can be done with the catalog and in main it is written to add elements to each of the car dealerships, after which, the consultant, which contains the only variable for output - allCatalogs in the Consultant class , displays all information about cars.
