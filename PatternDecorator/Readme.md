# Decorator

The idea in [DecoratorProject](https://github.com/Glevelll/Design-Patterns/tree/main/PatternDecorator/DecoratorProject) is to create shawarma. There is a main class - shawarma, where it can be made classic or cheese, there is an inherited class from shawarma - components, where you can add some components: cheese, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. For each class, there is an amount that the client will pay for classic or cheese shawarma, and if there are any additives to shawarma, then the price will increase. In main, 3 variants of shawarma are implemented.
